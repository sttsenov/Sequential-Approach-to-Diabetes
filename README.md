# Sequential-Approach-to-Diabetes
An Artificial Neaural Network model, that is able to predict whether a person has diabetes or not by following a sequential approach. The model uses 8 attributes to come up with an outcome which will be either a logic 1 or a 0. 

# Approach
The model is an implementation of the Keras Sequential model and has 4 Dense layer. All the layers have an ReLU activation function except the last one that uses Sigmoid to output 1 or 0
 
# Accuracy
After being trained for 1000 epochs the model has an average accuracy of 91% on the training data and 85% on the testing dataset
